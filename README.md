Learning project - 

- Cloned nodejs from gitHub onto a Debian Google VM, built and installed from source (done), get nodejs server started and install and use pm2 to manage node processes - install and configure nginx server from scratch (done for http, todo for https). 
- Then I downloaded building permit information from the city of toronto onto the VM
